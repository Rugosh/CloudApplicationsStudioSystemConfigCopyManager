# Cloud Application System Config Helper

A very quick (and dirty) programm to move the system configuration to the new Studio version with every release.

Basicly it is nothing else than a quick programm to move the Config from the source path to the target path with X as the last release and X as the current release.

Source Path:
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SAP\SAPCloudApplicationsStudio\X\DialogPage\SAP.Copernicus.CopernicusOptionPage


Target Path:
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SAP\SAPCloudApplicationsStudio\YYY\DialogPage\SAP.Copernicus.CopernicusOptionPage
